#The King of Fighters Training Mode for FB

I just recently discovered lua scripting and this is my first attempt of a training mode for KOF.
This is a refactored version of the existing trainings like:

https://github.com/maximusmaxy/JoJoban-Training-Mode-Menu-FBNeo

https://github.com/Jesuszilla/mame-rr-scripts

#Features

For now the only feature is an OSD for kof96 but I'm intended to add:

- Input display
- Hitboxes
- Record Input
- Menu

If you are an expert finding Hex addresses please contact me on twitter @arpeggiate so we can add more cool features.

#How to execute this?

1) Download the script
2) Open your Fightcade2 FBNeo emulator
3) Run KOF96
4) Go to Game -> Lua Scripting -> New Lua Script Window
5) Browse the training.lua file and click on run
6) Make sure your video blitter settings is set to "DirectX9Alt"
